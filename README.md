**Abstract**

Biophysical models often require shelf-scale domains to map larval dispersal over several weeks, presenting a computational challenge. This can be overcome by decreasing model spatial resolution; however, nearshore processes will inevitably be unresolved, which potentially play a significant role in larval dispersal. Here, we evaluate how simulated larval dispersal in the nearshore is sensitive to model spatial resolution. We use an unstructured, finite element, hydrodynamic model of a topographically-complex coastline (which includes headlands, bays and channels) at four different spatial scales (50, 100, 250, 500 m) to compare the influence of spatial resolution on transport and dispersal patterns of particles released within the nearshore region (within 1 km of the shore). In the higher resolution (50 and 100 m) simulations, particles generally travelled offshore more quickly and further (~18%) than in the coarser (250 and 500 m) simulations. The coarser resolution simulations were more retentive (~50%) in the nearshore zone than the higher resolution simulations, resulting in increased (~33%) overall strength of alongshore connectivity but fewer (~10%) total source23 sink connections. Our case study represents a highly energetic and topographically complex region, where we find that model spatial resolution of â‰¤100 m should be used for dispersal studies in the nearshore zone. Our results add to growing evidence of the importance of using appropriately scaled models when simulating the transport of material within- and out of- the coastal zone, with implications for marine ecology, marine biosecurity, marine spatial planning and marine litter.
